# A fun zig manager built with zig

While there are other great options for zig installation management, I wanted something that aligned more with workflows I was used to coming from the Node world, like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), while learning Zig. Particularly I wanted more fine-grained ability to download and control versions, but also auto switching and env management built in.
